# Mood-Tracker
Created a web app that allows users to track their mental health over time. Individual data is collected based on a daily mood quiz that is graphed longitudinally. Users are also encouraged to practice gratitude through a journaling section.


## Motivation
This project was inspired by the research that found journaling helped individuals process difficult emotions and overall improved their mental health. We aimed to build a tool that could be used in conjunction with other self-care techniques in order to be able to track overall well being and increase individual happiness.
